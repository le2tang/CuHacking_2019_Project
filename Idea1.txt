Beat Detection Algorithm

It is reasonable to believe that the lowest BPM that needs to be calculated is 60 Bpm (1 Hz)
The lowest frequency needed for this application is 70 Bpm
Generally, if the Bpm is any lower, it is more useful to count the beats of the next logical note length (quarter note -> eigth note)
We can assume that at least two beats will occur within a time period of 3s at 60 Bpm, 2.58s at 70Bpm
For the purposes of this algorthm, the lowest beat frequency is 70 Bpm

#define MIN_FREQUENCY 70

If we are sampling at an industry standard 44.1KHz, we need a buffer of length 113400, which is 453.6KB of data
Using a window size of 1024, we can reduce dimensionality to 43 elements for each second of sound, this is 172B of data
This is a decimating low pass filter
If we want to use a pingpong buffer, the memory size of the input buffers doubles to 344

1. Detect note onsets
	Detect the energy of each frequency using a short time Fourier Transform
2. Apply logarithmic compression
	Adjusts dynamic range of frequency signal to enhance weaker spectral components
	Accounts for logarithmic sensation of sound intensity
3. Compute discrete derivative for each frequency band
	From this point on, it is possible to only consider frequencies around 60Hz, 500Hz or
		other predominant drum 	frequencies
	Only positive increases are considered
4. Sum up positive differences for each time band
5. Compute local average, subtract from original curve, this gives the novelty curve
6. Compute windowed sinusoid correlated to a a frame of the novelty curve (local periodicity kernel)
7. Accumulate (sum) all maximizing kernels over time to obtain a single curve
8. Apply half wave rectification to give Predominant Local Pulse curve
